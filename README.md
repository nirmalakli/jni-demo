Application demonstrating interfacing Java with native code via JNI

Purpose of this project is to demonstrate interoperability between Java and native C++ code. This
is primarily developed on a Linux desktop; hence the C++ code was compiled via g++. The same code
can be compiled on a Windows PC without any changes in C++ code. The compiler would be Microsoft CL
. It could also be compiled via Cygwin installed on Windows. I don't expect any changes for Apple
MAC systems.
